    "> #### Walter Grey's Turtoise \n",
    "> Walter Grey was a British physiologist pioneer in biologically-based robotics. He created autonomous robots with simple mechanism that were capable of generating more complex behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    ">\"His wheeled robots, or ‘tortoises’, had two valves, two relays, two motors, two condensers, and one sensor (for light or for touch). In effect, then, a Grey Walter tortoise had only two neurones. For, crucially, the tortoises weren’t mere toys but models of (very simple) nervous systems.\"\n",
    "\n",
    ">More detailed information on Grey's work and the turtoises can be found in the source for this topic: http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/article020101.html \n",

    ">In 1967, Daniel G. Bobrow, Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon created the logical oriented programme language called LOGO. The turtle (named in tribute to Grey's Turtoise) is a robot that moves and  controls a pen, it was created with the intention to teach children the logic in programming.\n",
    ">Children would imagine themselves as the turtle. They could understand and predict the outcomes of possible movements through logic. Papert coined the term **“body syntonic reasoning”** to describe this.\n",

    "##                              Some Useful Settings and Methods for Turtle\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "            These tables show some of the values for various methods used in the Python turtle package.\n",
    "### **Speed**\n",
    "The methods that require a speed with which to move the cursor (turtle) take an integer argument. The integer is between 0 and 10, with 0 meaning no animated motion and 10 meaning the fastest animated motion. So if you have the speed set to 0, the turtle will jump around as you move it; there will be no animation.\n",
    ">**Turtle Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.speed(n )` sets the speed of the turtle tur to n, where n is as above.\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `turtle.tracer(num,num)` By calling tracer() with bother arguments set to zero, we are essentially turning off all\n",
    "animation and our drawings will be drawn “immediately.” However, if we turn the animation off in this way we need to explicitly update the image with the `update()` method after we are done issuing drawing commands. If you want to reset tracer() to its original settings, its arguments should be 1 and 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Color**\n",
    "The methods that require a color use a color specification string. The more common ones are:\n",
    ">`black` | `cyan` | `blue` | `gold` | `brown` | `gray`|\n",
    ">`green` | `magenta` | `orange`|\n",
    ">`pink` | `violet` | `purple`  |`white` | `red` | `yellow`\n",
    "\n",
    "A full list can be found at http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/colors.htm. You can also specify colors as mixtures or red, green, and blue as #rrggbb , where rr, gg, and bb are two hexadecimal digits each indicating the intensity of the color (with “00” meaning the color isn’t present and “FF” meaning it is as intense as possible).\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Turtle Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `win.bgcolor(col )` sets the background color of window win to col, where col is as above.\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.pencolor(col)` sets the color of the pen with which turtle draws on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Shapes**\n",
    "The methods that require a shape for the cursor (turtle) know the following shapes: \n",
    ">`arrow` | `turtle` | `circle` | `square` | `triangle` | `classic`\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Turtle Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.shape(img )` sets the shape of the turtle tur to img, where img is as above.\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.stamp()` stamps an image of the turtle cursor shape onto the screen. Alternately `tur.clearstamp()` clears all stamps of the specific turtle from the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Drawing Things**\n",
    "A “pen” is associated with each turtle. The pen can be in the “up” state or the “down” state. When you move the cursor (turtle), if the pen is down, the turtle draws a line from the current position to the new one. If the pen is up, the position of the turtle changes to the new one, but no line is drawn.\n",
    "You can draw a dot or a circle of a given size, too.\n",
    "You can also write text at the current location of the mouse.\n",
    ">**Turtle Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.goto(x, y)` moves the turtle tur from the current co-ordinates to (x, y). Alternatively, **tur.setx(int)** and **tur.sety(int)** methods work to set only the x or y coordinates of the turtle (where int is a numerical coorndinate). `tur.xcor()` and `tur.ycor()` return the current coordinates of the x or y state of the turtle 'tur'.\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.penup()` raises the pen (puts it into the “up” state) associated with the turtle tur. When you\n",
    "move the turtle, the co-ordinates change but no line is drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.pendown()` lowers the pen (puts it into the “down” state) associated with the turtle tur. When\n",
    "you move the turtle, the co-ordinates change and a line is drawn from the current co-ordinates to the\n",
    "given co-ordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `turtle.pensize(width)` or `turtle.width(width)` Set the line thickness to width or return it. If no argument is given, the current pensize is returned. Parameters:\twidth – a positive number. Alternately, `turtle.pen()` returns or set the pen’s attributes as in the following example: \n",
    "\n",
    ">turtle.pen(fillcolor=\"black\", pencolor=\"red\", pensize=10)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.dot(n )` draws a dot at the current position of the turtle tur. If n is present, the dot has diameter\n",
    "n pixels. If n is not present, the dot has a default size (the maximum of pensize + 4 and 2×pensize, where pensize is the width used to draw a line, if you must know).\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.circle(n )` draws a circle of radius n pixels, with the center n pixels left of the current position of the turtle tur.\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.write(string, move, align, (fontname, fontsize, fonttype ))` writes the given string at the current position of the turtle tur. It is positioned as indicated by align, which may take the (string) values \"left\", \"center\", or \"right\". The text is printed in the named fontname, with point size fontsize, in the type fonttype. Then, if move is True, the position of the turtle tur changes to the bottom right corner of the text. If move is omitted, it defaults to False; if align is omitted, it defaults to \"left\"; and if the font triplet is omitted, the font Ariel, with point size 8, in normal type, is used.\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.hideturtle()` hides the turtle 'tur' cursor. Alternately `tur.showturtle()` makes the turtle cursor visible. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Coloring in Shapes (Filling Shapes)**\n",
    "You can color in, or “fill”, a shape such as a rectangle or circle (or, really, anything). To do this, say you want to begin filling the shape then draw the shape, then say you are done. Filling is associated with a turtle, so if you have several active turtles, the filling is done only for the one(s) you indicate.\n",
    "By default, the fill color is the color of the turtle. You can change it to another color as described in the section Color, above.\n",
    ">**Turtle Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.begin_fill()` says to begin filling the shape subsequently drawn using turtle tur.\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.end_fill()` says to stop filling the shape drawn using turtle tur.\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `tur.fillcolor(col)` sets the fill color associated with the turtle tur to col, where col is as in the\n",
    "Color section above. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Window Control**\n",
    "Most of the examples in this section refer to a TurtleScreen instance called screen. \n",
    ">**Turtle Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    ">•`turtle.bgcolor(*args)` Set or return background color of the TurtleScreen.\n",
    "_Parameters:_ args – a color string or three numbers in the range 0...255 or hex value of a color.\n",
    "\n",
    ">•`turtle.bgpic(picname)` Set background image or return name of current backgroundimage. If picname is a filename, set the corresponding image as background. If picname is \"nopic\", delete background image, if present. If picname is None, return the filename of the current background image.\n",
    "_Parameters:_\tpicname – a string, name of a gif-file or \"nopic\", or None\n",
    "\n",
    ">•`turtle.clear()` or `turtle.clearscreen()` Delete all drawings and all turtles from the TurtleScreen. Reset the now empty TurtleScreen to its initial state: white background, no background image, no event bindings and tracing on.\n",
    "\n",
    ">•`turtle.reset()` or `turtle.resetscreen()` Reset all Turtles on the Screen to their initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    ">•`turtle.screensize(canvwidth, canvheight, bg)` Sets display screen size and background.\n",
    "_Parameters:_\t_canvwidth_ – positive integer, new width of canvas in pixels, _canvheight_ – positive integer, new height of canvas in pixels, _bg_ – colorstring or color code, new background color\n",
    "\n",
    ">•`turtle.setworldcoordinates(llx, lly, urx, ury)`\n",
    "\n",
    ">_Parameters:_\t\n",
    "\n",
    ">llx – a number, x-coordinate of lower left corner of canvas\n",
    "\n",
    ">lly – a number, y-coordinate of lower left corner of canvas\n",
    "\n",
    ">urx – a number, x-coordinate of upper right corner of canvas\n",
    "\n",
    ">ury – a number, y-coordinate of upper right corner of canvas\n",
    "\n",
    ">• `turtle.title(titlestring)`Set title of turtle window to the contents of 'titlestring'. Parameters:\ttitlestring – a string that is shown in the titlebar of the turtle graphics window\n",
    "\n",
    ">•`turtle.bye()`Shuts the turtlegraphics window.\n",
    "\n",
    ">•`turtle.exitonclick()` Binds bye() method to mouse clicks on the Screen.\n",

    "## Advanced Applications of Turtles\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "            As mentioned above, Turtles are not only used in Python but, also in other programmable modeling environments such as NetLogo. Therefore, we shall see its advance uses in a range of environments and understand its application in a broad spectrum of fields.\n",
    "            \n",
    "### **Uses**\n",
    "They are used to simulating natural and social phenomena and understand the emergence of patterns over time. This helps in understanding a wide range of design possibilities and restrictions and also in implementing real life parameters as a contributing factor in the design.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Application in Game softwares**\n",
    "\n",
    ">• The simplest way to visualize the simulation would be in game softwares. However, the application should not be underestimated as it involves a complex set of interaction between the user and the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/dOoicaC.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    ">• The above is a simple arcade style game developed using python called ReTux 1.1.2 \n",
    "> `Reference:http://pygame.org/project/2982/`\n",
    ">• To explain the workings of a game module, let's compare the Pygame to a wellknown arcade game such as PAC MAN\n",
    ">>`The central characters essentially have to navigate a maze of sorts and collect certain items while avoiding certain others to earn reward points` all this has to happen while inputs are being given by the user.\n",
    ">• This is essentially event- driven programming:\n",
    ">>`The central character can be imagined as a turtle which is conditioned by the inputs from the observer.`\n",
    ">>`The inputs from the user initiate functions which make the turtle behave in a certain way' \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Event- Driven Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    ">• There are several ways in which the user can give input for the turtles, a few of the methods are illustrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    ">' Keypress events '\n",
    "\n",
    ">• Each keypress can be configured to achieve a certain purpose: In relation to games it would essentially be controlling the main character's (turtle) movements so, the pressing of the LEFT, RIGHT, UP or DOWN keys would initiate different functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "> A simple click of a particular mouse button with out the actual need to locate the cursor. This could for example simply start or end a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Another method of input would be to identify the exact position of the mouse on the screen and initiate a function in relation to that specific input. This therefore, requires the X and Y co-ordinates of the position of the cursor when the mouse was clicked.\n",

    "\n",
    ">• Python programming has been utilised in traffic signals : so, the best example to visualize the above event- driven programming would be to envision the Sheffield traffic system as the model\n",

    "\n",
    ">> After a particular amount of time the pedestrian signal changes to green.\n",
