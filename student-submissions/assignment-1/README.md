Your assignment for this week is to create two examples of 'turtle art' using Python and Jupyter notebooks. Your submission for each example should include 1) an image of the final graphical result; and 2) your Jupyter notebook, including Python code and comments that describe your intentions, things you found difficult, and anything else that you would like to communicate.
