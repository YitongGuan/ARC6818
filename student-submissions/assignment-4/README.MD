Your assignment for this week is to go through the preliminary steps of evaluating the Titanic passenger dataset . Please formulate two questions that you can use to query, restructure and understand this dataset. Among the questions you could consider asking:

  What can be learned about the chances of survival from a passenger's age, cabin, class or fare?
  Was it advantageous for survival to be a child? To be above 65?
  Which passenger attribute do you think gives the best prediction of survival? Provide evidence to support your conclusion.
  Was it advantageous for survival to have been traveling with family members on the Titanic (this requires significant feature engineering)?
  What interesting stories can be told about the passengers on board the Titanic using this data?
The dataset has multiple gaps which you will need to account for, either by explaining why they're not that important or by filling them with estimated values. You may optionally use histograms, or any other plots that you choose to visualize your conclusions.
