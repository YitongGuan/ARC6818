This week's short assignment is based on a dataset titled 'Climatological Database for the World's Oceans 1750-1850' which contains ~250,000 individual ship's log entries. Detailed information about the data can be found at the project web site. The data can be downloaded here; the data is contained in 'CLIWOC15.zip' and various additional information is available as well including translations of wind force terms ('Dictionary_text.pdf') and a collection of files describing the individual columns ('CLIWOC15Additional.zip'). Only the data file is needed to complete this assignment.

The code examples used in this notebook, and many others exploring the CLIWOC dataset can be found on the Kaggle Ocean Ship Logbooks page. For a fascinating discussion of digitized ships logs as a source for historical research check out this blog post.

Your challenge is to extract a compelling narrative from the data, presenting your narrative using text, images and data visualization. The narrative should focus on a specific aspect of the data captured in this dataset. Because the data is so diverse, you will need to select a particular attribute of the data to focus on in your work. Some topics that you could consider:

animal sightings
a battle or conflict
a severe storm 
the route followed by a particular ship
the geographic distribution of icebergs
You can find examples of these and many other types of observation on the Kaggle web site. If you choose to build on someone else's code, please be sure to indicate clearly in the comments what you have borrowed and how you have built on (added to) the code.
